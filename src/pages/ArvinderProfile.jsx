      <h3>Course Objective</h3>
      <p>
        To measure various plasma parameters with the help of single and double Langmuir probes, 
        to study the breakdown voltage of a given plasma, to obtain the plasma coating on a substrate 
        and also cleaning of substrate surfaces, to launch and detect ion acoustic waves, to understand 
        the microwave plasma, to understand the conditions of occurrence of striations. 
        Basic understanding acquired will be helpful in industry as well as for doing experimental plasma research.
